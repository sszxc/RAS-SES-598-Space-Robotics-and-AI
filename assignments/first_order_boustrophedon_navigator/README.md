![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/940fc6bc-fcee-4d11-8bc8-d53a650aaf80)

In this assignment, you will understand the provided code in ROS2 with Turtlesim, and refactor and/or tune the navigator to implement a precise lawnmower survey (a boustrophedon pattern). The current code will do a pattern shown above, which is not a uniform lawnmower survey. 
Explore literature on how lawnmower surveys typically look, and modify the code to meet the requirements for a uniform survey. 

## Background
Boustrophedon patterns (from Greek: "ox-turning", like an ox drawing a plow) are fundamental coverage survey trajectories useful in space exploration and Earth observation. These patterns are useful for:

- **Space Exploration**: Rovers could use boustrophedon patterns to systematically survey areas of interest, ensuring complete coverage when searching for geological samples or mapping terrain. However, due to energy constraints, informative paths are usually optimized, and this results in paths that are sparser than complete coverage sampling, and may still produce high-accuracy reconstructions. 
  
- **Earth Observation**: Aerial vehicles employ these patterns for:
  - Agricultural monitoring and precision farming
  - Search and rescue operations
  - Environmental mapping and monitoring
  - Geological or archaeological surveys
  
- **Ocean Exploration**: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use boustrophedon patterns to:
  - Map the ocean floor
  - Search for shipwrecks or aircraft debris
  - Monitor marine ecosystems
  
The efficiency and accuracy of these surveys depend heavily on the robot's ability to follow the prescribed path with minimal deviation (cross-track error). This assignment simulates these real-world challenges in a 2D environment using a first-order dynamical system (the turtlesim robot).

## Objective
Tune a PD controller to make a first-order system execute the most precise boustrophedon pattern possible. The goal is to minimize the cross-track error while maintaining smooth motion.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding PD control parameters and their effects on first-order systems
- Practical experience with controller tuning
- Analysis of trajectory tracking performance
- ROS2 visualization and debugging

## The Challenge

### 1. Controller Tuning (60 points)

```

```

2. Launch the demo:
```bash
ros2 launch first_order_boustrophedon_navigator boustrophedon.launch.py
```

3. Monitor performance:
```bash
# View cross-track error as a number
ros2 topic echo /cross_track_error

# Or view detailed statistics in the launch terminal
```

- Discussion for tuning:
- 首先配置好合适的工具,在本次作业中,rqt_reconfigure和rqt_plot是很好的工具,可以实时查看和调整参数,并可视化性能.
- 然后通过观察分析,大胆调试非常小和非常大的参数值,大致理解每个参数的作用
- 先调整kp,然后是kd,从小参数值开始,二分法调整
- 在调整kd的过程中,可以明显看到曲线过冲,因此需要调整kd,使得曲线更加平滑
  
- Discussion for tuning:
1. First, set up appropriate tools. In this assignment, rqt_reconfigure and rqt_plot are excellent tools that allow real-time parameter adjustment and performance visualization.

2. Then, through observation and analysis, boldly test both very small and very large extreme parameter values to understand the function of each parameter.
3. Start by adjusting Kp, then Kd, beginning with small parameter values and using a binary search approach for adjustment.
4. During the Kd adjustment process, you can clearly observe curve overshooting, therefore Kd needs to be adjusted to make the curve smoother.

- Challenges and solutions:
1. I have never use ros2 before, so need to spend time to become familiar with the development and tools of ros2, especially the differences from ros1.
